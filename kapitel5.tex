\section{Summary and recommendations}

\onehalfspacing

Infrastructure-as-Code is a good tool to enforce regulatory compliance and security hardening uniformly across all deployed Kubernetes clusters.

We were able to show that the combination of Terraform together with Rancher templates provide an ideal solution for Enterprise IT to provision a secure and compliant container run-time environment and manage the infrastructure life cycle.

There are alternatives. Platform-native solutions for the major hyperscale platforms do exist, for example ARM templates on Microsoft Azure. Also, the leading on-premise virtualization platforms, VMware and Hyper-V, each have a native orchestration solution.

Rancher and Terraform, however, are an open-source and provider-independent
option and thus the recommended choice.

New developments in the area of serverless computing threaten compute infrastructure as a distinct category itself and might obliterate the need for secure and compliant orchestration tools.

Regardless of future developments, governance, risk management and regulatory compliance will remain a key topic in Enterprise IT.
