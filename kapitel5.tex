\section{Summary and recommendations}

\onehalfspacing

Infrastructure-as-Code is a good tool to enforce regulatory compliance and security hardening uniformly across all deployed Kubernetes clusters.

We were able to show that the combination of Terraform together with Rancher templates provide an ideal solution for Enterprise IT to provision a secure and compliant container run-time environment and manage the infrastructure life cycle.

Rancher and Terraform are the only open-source, provider-independent
solution and thus the recommended choice.

There are, however, platform-native solutions for the major hyperscale platforms, for example ARM templates on Microsoft Azure. Also, new developments in the area of serverless computing threaten compute infrastructure as a distinct category itself.

Regardless of future developments, governance, risk management and regulatory compliance will remain a key topic in Enterprist IT.
