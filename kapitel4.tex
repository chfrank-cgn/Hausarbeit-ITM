\subsection{CIS Benchmarks for Kubernetes}

In the previous chapter we've covered the basic mechanism to codify and enforce standards for our Kubernetai across our IT organization, using Terraform and Rancher templates. Now let's move one step further and look at checking our clusters for security issues.

There are many security standards and recommendations available for IT, but there is one organization that's universally recognized as leading the field of IT security and compliance: The Center for Internet Security, Inc. (CIS®)

CIS is a community-driven nonprofit and responsible for CIS Controls® and CIS Benchmarks™, which are globally recognized as the best practices for securing IT systems and data. If you want to have a look at the actual CIS Benchmarks, they are available for download on the CIS website, you'll need to register with CIS first, though.

Testing a platform against a CIS Benchmark is usually a lengthy process. Fortunately there are a number of automated scan tools available for Kubernetes, and with Rancher 2.4 a CIS Scan is now available for all managed Clusters right from the Rancher GUI.

CIS Scans can be invoked manually or scheduled on a regular basis, with reporting done through Rancher's Alert Manager. With Terraform provider version 1.8.0 (March 2020), this feature is now also available in Terraform.\footnote{See \textit{Rancher Labs (2020)}: Changelog. \cite{ChangeLog}}

\subsection{CIS Scan GUI}

In the classic GUI, at cluster level, Rancher offers two choices of CIS Scans:

\begin{itemize}
\item RKE-CIS-1.4 Permissive
\item RKE-CIS-1.4 Hardened
\end{itemize}

Both scans are based on the Kubernetes CIS Benchmark version 1.4, with different sets of enabled controls and are adapted by Rancher to the underlying Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE). A default installation will pass the permissive profile tests. To pass the hardened profile, you'll need to fully adhere to the Rancher 2.3 Hardening guide.\footnote{See \textit{Rancher Labs (2019)}: Hardening Guide. \cite{hardeningGuide}}

The cluster we created in the previous chapter is using mostly default values and thus does not pass the scan with the hardened profile:

\subsection{Hardened CIS Scan}

We will not go through all hardening steps in detail, but look at one control as an example:

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:cisScanFail}
\end{figure}

The control we'll be focusing on is 1.1.24: Ensure that the admission control plugin PodSecurityPolicy is set.

To fully harden your cluster, please follow the hardening instructions mentioned above, for now we'll look at the missing Pod Security Policy.

\subsection{Kubernetes Security Policies}

What is a Pod Security Policy (PSP)? Kubernetes provides two types of security policies, one for pod security and one for network security. Pod security policies, as the name implies, govern security-relevant aspects of pod specification,\footnote{See \textit{The Linux Foundation (2019)}: Pod Security Policies. \cite{podSecurity}} whereas network policies govern the allowed communication between groups of pods and the outside world.\footnote{See \textit{The Linux Foundation (2019)}: Network Policies. \cite{netSecurity}}

It is good practice when running a Kubernetes cluster in production to secure access with Pod Security Policies.\footnote{See \textit{Price, J. (2020)}: Kubernetes - Pod Security Policies. \cite{examplePsp}} Rancher offers two pre-built PSPs (named "restricted" and "unrestriced") and a GUI to create your own.\footnote{See \textit{Iradier, A. (2020)}: Enhancing Kubernetes Security with Pod Security Policies. \cite{detailPsp}}

There are many controls within a Pod Security Policy that we won't be able to cover in this document, instead we'll focus on the admission controller.

\subsection{Remediation}

The scan gives us the following remediation instruction:

\verb|Remediation: Follow the documentation and create Pod Security Policy objects as per your environment|

To mitigate the failed control, what we need to do is to add a default Pod Security Policy. Fortunately, that's fairly easy in Rancher. In the cluster template we need to enable PSP support and define the default policy.

We can do that by adding the following line to our template definition in Terraform:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Cluster Template, frame=single, basicstyle=\ttfamily]
default_pod_security_policy_template_id = "restricted"
\end{lstlisting}

Or, if your prefer the Rancher GUI, you can set the default Pod Security Policy there too:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\caption {Rancher PSP Support}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/rancher-psp-support.png}
\label{fig:rancherPSP}
\end{figure}

Once you've enabled the PSP, the control will pass in the CIS scan. It's an iterative process: Based on the needs of your IT organization, you'll have to identify the controls critical for your business and implement the remediation steps one by one, as needed, to harden your cluster.

Automated CIS scans will then give you a very valuable tool to regularly check all your Kubernetai for security issues and regulatory compliance, and help you to act on issues accordingly.
